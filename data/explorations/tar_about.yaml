    value: "<b>Using Tar</b><p>Open source software is commonly released in the\
     \ form of archives called tarballs. The tar program creates, unpacks, and\
     \ manipulates such archives.</p><p>When packaging a project's source code,\
     \ it is customary to place the files within a directory named after the project\
     \ with a version number. This makes creating and unpacking such tarballs\
     \ convenient, as you only have to name one directory to tar up when creating\
     \ the tarball, and people who unpack your tarball end up with a self-contained\
     \ directory that they can easily remove when they are finished using the set\
     \ of files you gave them.</p><p>This mission consists of two parts:  unpacking\
     \ tarballs and creating tarballs.</p>"
